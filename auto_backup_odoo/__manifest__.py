        This module automates the backup process for ODOO databases.
         It converts the PSQL database into the proper format specified in the master backup form under the general settings.
          It is capable of backing up and restoring databases larger than 1GB using the pg_restore format.
           The cronjob for this module performs the backup daily, but the interval for the backup process can be modified in the
            Automation Scheduled Actions-> Dump Current Odoo DB .
